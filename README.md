# Marvin
Marvin is a repo that providse general purpose microservices with basic use cases, and the facilities to extend or customize for a special doain design for scalable Infrastructure

## Structures
- General purpose microservices 
- An example special domain service: Financial Management Application
- Scripts describe the construction of the projects

## Application
- Use Spring Boot framework to construct application code base on the framework's AOP and IoC supports
- Use kafka for communication between services


## Infrastructure
- Ready for a leverage of automating application deployment, scaling, and management

## Guideline
- [Reactive approach](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
- [Microservice Architecture Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/microservices/)
