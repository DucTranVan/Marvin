# Marvin

**Marvin is a ProductionReady used for speed up building microservices based application.

## Structures

- General purpose microservices 
- An example special domain service: Personal financial Management Application.
- Scripts describe the construction of the projects.


## Criteria

- Provide general purpose microservices with basic use cases, and the facilities to extend or customize for a special domain. 
- Provide scalable Infrastructure.
- Expose some PoC of concrete special domain applications

### Application 

- Use Spring Boot framework to construct application code base on the framework's AOP and IoC supports.
- Use gRPC for communication between core services


### Infrastructure

- Use K8s as the container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.
